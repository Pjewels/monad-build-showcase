Thank you for investing your time in contributing!

## About the Project

A showcase platform for community-built applications and tools in the Monad ecosystem.

### Rules

1. **All code contributions require an Issue** to be created and agreed upon before submitting a Pull Request
2. Contributors must be humans, not bots
3. First-time contributions must not contain only spelling or grammatical fixes

## Requirements
- **Create an issue first** - All PRs must reference an existing issue
- Follow TypeScript/React best practices
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Add/do tests for new features

## Getting Started

You can contribute by:
- Solving open issues
- Reporting bugs or feature requests  
- Improving documentation

### Issues

Scan through [existing issues](https://github.com/zaki9501/monad-build-showcase/issues) to find one that interests you. If you find an issue to work on, assign it to yourself and open a PR.

#### Create a New Issue
- Provide as much context as possible
- Include steps to reproduce bugs or reasons for new features
- Screenshots and videos are highly appreciated

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo

3. Make your changes
4. **Link to issue** - Reference issue number (Closes #123)
5. Use descriptive title
6. Include screenshots or videos for UI changes
7. Ensure tests pass (if applicable)
